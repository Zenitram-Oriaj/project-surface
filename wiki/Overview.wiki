#summary Overview of Project Surface.

= Overview =

Project Surface is based on the work I did for our Innovation Days at work.
So thanks to [http://www.citrix.com Citrix] for allowing me to do blue sky research and then open sourcing the details. 
Hopefully any one following these instructions can build a relatively cheap touch surface and use it with a standard Windows 8 PC with no extra drivers.

= Details =

To get started you will need to decide on the type of touch surface you want to build. There are various type of table, but the one I chose uses IR edge lit plexiglass, a back surface projection layer, front-surfaced mirror, projector and IR camera using TUIO.

The software is using [http://ccv.nuigroup.com/ CCV] running on a Macbook passing TUIO packets to an [http://www.arduino.cc/ Arduino MegaADK board with ethernet].

The Arduino software in this repository is based on the [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php LUFA project] and provides a standard USB touch device to Windows 8, which passes the HCK tests.
This enables a zero driver install on Windows 8, once the CCV software is calibrated.

The project video shows Windows 8 running on a Macbook Pro in a Parallels VM. The Macbook is also running a native build of CCV doing the Vision processing which passes the TUIO packets through ethernet to the Arduino board which converts them to Windows 8 touch device input via USB.
